# Issues with ABIDE-II data.

I downloaded the ABIDE-II data from Amazon bucket using cyberduck on Mac. There were 2 sites that were missing - Stanford University and University of Miami. So I downloaded those sites from the [ABIDE-II website](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html). I remaned them according to phenotype file: 

> ABIDEII-ETHZ_1 -> ABIDEII-ETH_1 

> ABIDEII-ONRC_2 -> ABIDEII-OILH_2 

> ABIDEII-STANFORD -> ABIDEII-SU_2 

> ABIDEII-UM -> ABIDEII-U_MIA_1
